#📦 Web-based Inventory System


This project is a Web-based Inventory Management System designed to simplify and automate stock management for businesses. It includes powerful features like expiry tracking, real-time data handling, and an interactive dashboard — all built for usability and efficiency.
🔑 Key Features
✅ Expiry Date Tracking
Allows users to add expiry dates for inventory items.

The system automatically checks for approaching expiry dates.

Sends notifications/alerts when items are close to or past their expiration (e.g., 2 weeks before).

✅ Real-Time Database
Uses a real-time database (e.g., MySQL, Firebase, or another backend).

Any updates (add/edit/delete) to products reflect immediately in the interface.

Ensures consistency across different users or sessions.

✅ CRUD Operations
Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for inventory items.

Allows full control over product data like name, quantity, price, and expiry date.

✅ Automated Alerts
System generates automatic alerts for:

Low stock

Upcoming or expired items

Custom thresholds if needed

Helps prevent stock-outs and wastage.

✅ Interactive Dashboard
A clean, dynamic UI built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

Displays real-time data insights like:

Stock levels

Expired items

Low inventory items

Designed for ease of use with filtering and visual indicators.
